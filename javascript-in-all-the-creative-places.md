"Creative Technologist"
Agencies sell creative as art. But think art != technology. Yet anyone in technology knows that technology is creative.

The Law of The Instrument
"I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail" - Maslow

Don't over rely on a tool so you aren't forcing the solution based on the tool.

#AI
General AI ie. Her
Narrow AI - focused on specific areas

Machine Learning - dump in a bunch of data, give it some algorithms and then use the results to predict things in the future

Deep Learning - often same as neural networks, is like machine learning with a whole bunch of layers/nodes which each analyze and return results

Democratization of AI
- all these different AI tools are available as APIs (image process, natural language, etc)
- all the major players have AI as API's 

Movidius usb [neural compute stick](https://developer.movidius.com/) that does AI
Raspberry Pi can run Tensorflow

AI & JavaScript
- js used to play [Flappybird with AI](https://github.com/TsReaper/AI-Plays-FlappyBird_
- [Landlines](https://lines.chromeexperiments.com/), from Zach Lieberman and Google creative

#3D for Everyone
[Milgram's Reality-Virtuality Continuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality%E2%80%93virtuality_continuum)
Reality --- Augmented Reality --- Augmented Virtuality --- Virtual Reality

#Bunch of stuff
Mixed Reality with JS
- HoloJS
- Mixed-Reality-JS - this is a wrapper on HoloJS making it as easy as three.js
- AR.js

WebVR - starting to be supported in most browsers, in Chrome in experimental (enable with flag)
- A-Frame for writing VR apps

p5.js - Processing in the browser

[sketch.js](http://soulwire.github.io/sketch.js/) - created by Soulwire, simple library for easily writing sketches in browser

[Gibber](http://gibber.cc/)

Glitch.com - https://glitch.com/

#Internet Of Things & Robotics
Often thought of as useless things - and often it is. 

[Nodebots](http://nodebots.io/) - basic robotics, powered by JavaScript using node.js

Building little sumo bots using nodebots is a great team builder and learning exercise.

[Johnny-Five](http://johnny-five.io/) - robotics & IoT platform

Tessel 2 - javascript enabled microcontroller

Web Bluetooth API
- increasingly available for connecting bluetooth devices to the browser

Puck.js - bluetooth enabled controller

micro:bit - tiny board co-developed by the BBC
