How Artificial Intelligence Can Bring Hugs, Not the Apocalypse

"So will AI kill us all?"

##Short history in the last couple years:
- things like chatbots that were getting people out of parking tickets
- chatbots helping Kenyan farmers
- AI platforms becoming more accessible, machine learning, natural language, vision, etc
- major players are all onboard (Microsoft has 8000 employees in AI R&D), plus Amazon, Google, Apple
- while people are uninstalling apps, the messaging apps persist
- suddenly everyone is clamouring for pundits to talk about AI on the nightly news

##Where are we now?
- Zuckerberg vs Musk very different views on where AI is headed
- news cycle changing, from hype to focus on the negative ie. Microsoft's Tay who learned to be incredibly racist
- refer to the hype curve, one year ago we were at the peak of inflated expectations, now we are in the trough of disillusionment
- Most technology goes through the disillusionment phase: "why would I want to touch my screen?", 
"why would I want to just use 140 characters in a message?", "why would I use emojis?", etc

##Case Studies

###InDro
- company uses drones to do rapid response reconnaissance on ships in distress or to look for survivors from a sunken ship
- initially rescuers needed to manually review photos looking for survivors
- Microsoft worked with them to use vision services and machine learning to allow computers to pick up survivors in life jackets
 in images of water. Can train AI to determine if a photo has a kayak in it, etc. Massively reduces the workload and speed of 
 response
 
 ###ViaSport
 - service to help atheletes with disabilities to find instructors and coaches
 - engaged Microsoft to help them build a chatbot to help people find the services faster
 - intially company wasn't sure about the bot, thought SEO and search was sufficient
 - found the chatbot helped them much better understand the nature of the information people were looking for and how they were 
 looking for it
 - added emotional analysis to determine if someone was upset or angry so they could be forwarded to an actual person to help 
 them out immediately
 - used the chatbot to naturally and subtley introduce better language to people to help describe themselves
 - important to engage people representative of your actual audience for your chatbot to ensure you are using the correct 
 language and conversation style for the service ie. had a paraolympian in the room to help
 
 ##Artificial Intelligence Design Principles
 - AI must be designed to assist people
 - AI must be transparent
 - AI must maximize efficiencies without destroying the dignity of people
 - AI must be designed for intelligent privacy
 - AI must have algorithmic accountability so that humans can undo unintended harm
 - AI must guard against bias, ensuring proper, and representative research so that the wrong heuristics cannot be used to 
 discriminate
 
 AI and bots are not here to replace humans. Don't try and make them human. Be clear that a bot is a bot and about what the bot is capable of.
 
 ##How does AI react in crisis?
 - get the bot out of the way
 - use sentiment analysis to determine when someone really needs actual human help immediately
 - at the very least use it to determine the tone of conversation, should the bot be cutesy ot serious? These are important 
 for connecting and maintaining a connection with users
 
 ##Conversation Plan
 - have your conversation narrative planned before coding
 - what are the pathways, how do they relate
 - map it out
 
 ##Anti-patterns to watch out for
 - the mysterious bot
 - the bot that never forgets
 - etc
 
 ##Getting a job in AI
 - AI will move from a role to a tool in traditional roles: machine learning engineers will become developer with AI skills
 - find projects that you can augment with AI
 - decide if you want to apply AI or do you want to build the foundational tools?
 
 Will AI kill us? Probably not. Rather, we tend to focus on the negative. Negativity sells. People will use AI for no good. 
 ie. Ad networks are already using it to figure out how to show us more targeted ads. Rather, it's up to us, the developers 
 and designers to steer it in the best direction. There will be a point where we really need to reflect on AI and what it can do. 
 Don't dismiss AI when things go awry, find the good ways to apply it and ensure we adhere to the design principles, maintain 
 our morals, and think ethically about our usage of it.
