#How do you navigate completely by keyboard without using the mouse?

Disabilities are not binary, the fall across a wide spectrum of situations. Build products for human diversity. From vision 
problems to repetitive stress injuries, not all disabilities are permanent. 

Slack has built in Accessibility settings that each user can customize. ie. "Allow animated images and emoji" - this came as 
many users complained about these things causing motion sickness or seizures, etc.

##Various keyboard navigation implementations in the Slack app
First thing Slack implemented: Tab navigation. Ensure that tab took you through the UI in a logical way, triggering hover 
and focus states. Don't forget tooltips as well. If they are important on hover, they are important on Tab.

Anywhere in the product, the up/down arrows move up and down through the messages, highlighting them with large blue boxes.

Control + ` jumps through sections of the ui

cmd+k opens a channel search/browse dialogue

##What's next for Slack accessibility
Adding in screenreader support. Getting keyboard controls in was the foundation step to next levels of accessibility.
