Playing with Chaos - Fractals and Strange Attractors
---------------------------------------------
*with Keith Peters*

Kinds of math/art/fun code:
###Recreational Mathematics
- puzzles, games, etc

###Algorithmic/Generative Art
- art generated by a computer with code

#Fractals 
- shapes made of other shapes
- each part is a copy of the whole

Koch Curve
Koch Snowflake

Fractals - infinitely repeatable - except limited by pixels and by memory when zooming in. Even in nature eventually zooming 
in fractals will break down when you start to hit cellular or molecular levels.

Fractal Trees
Symmetry and Regularity. Exact copies of each shape and positioning in equally different relationships. By making certain 
things less symmetrical, varying angles, varying sizes, you start to get something looking even more interesting with some variety.

Pythagorean Fractal

The Richardson Effect - as you measure different coastlines in the world, some increase more and some less, can be used a gauge 
to determine how rocky a coast is

Benoit Mandelbrot - Fractal Dimensions comparing coastlines to algorithms
