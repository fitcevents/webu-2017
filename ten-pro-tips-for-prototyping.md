Ten Pro Tips for Prototyping
------------------------------
*with [Fred Beecher](http://twitter.com/fred_beecher)*

Fred sorts his tips into two main categories: __tactical__ and __strategic__.
You can find his slides on his Twitter profile (linked above).

* #### tactical
    * ##### be lazy
        * prototype just enough to achieve your goal
        * in order to do this, you need to have a clearly defined goal
            * it would be perfectly reasonable to create prototypes to _disprove_ certain ideas, or to get an idea off the table
    * ##### plan before you prototype
        * write the usability test plan before you build your prototype
            *
    * ##### create plausible content
    * ##### think lo-fi
        * (as much as is possible, depending on the problem/usability test at hand)
        * what is the lowest level of visual and functional fidelity that you can get away with?
    * ##### choose your weapon
        * use the right tool for the job
            * what's your goal?
            * what level of functional fidelity do you need to achieve your goal?
            * is this native mobile?
            * this can be informed by user research, but should also balance resource availability
        * invision inspect
            * consumes a sketch file and highlights important things for developers
                * spacing between elements
                * some basic CSS
                * Zeplin is less integrated with Invision
    * ##### show examples; document details
        * show __and__ tell
            * just showing doesn't really reveal all detail
            * just telling is straight-up annoying
                * __do both__.
        * show at least one example of every interaction
            * off of the top of your head, there are probably five or six things that could go wrong in a login page
                * you do not need to prototype all of these
                * write the error message for what happens if someone gets a username wrong
                    * then, in your documentation, write out all of those variations
                    * they __do not__ all need to exist in the prototype
* #### strategic
    * ##### take risks
        * go with your crazy ideas, then test them
    * ##### seek _in_-validation
        * look for failures rather than successes
        * tell participants you had nothing to do with these designs, whether that is true or not
            * this will help minimize people holding back negative feedback for fear of being offensive
    * ##### prototype _everything_
        * you can prototype more than just digital products
    * ##### prototype everywhere
        * doesn't have to just be in the middle of the process
        * prototyping is useful at _all_ stages of product development
