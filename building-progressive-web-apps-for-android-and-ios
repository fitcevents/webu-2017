#Core Tenents of a PWA

Response designed - really should be doing this whether you are making a PWA or not  
Connectivity independent - mobile devices have unreliable connections and the app should be built as such  
App Like - app shell model  
Safe - served over https to prevent snooping and ensure content hasn't been tampered with  
Re-engageable - make re-engagement through features like push notifications  
Installable - allow users to add apps to their home screen without the hassle of an app store  
Linkable - easily share the app via url
