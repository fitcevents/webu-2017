Product Strategy Playbook
------------------------------
*with Kurt Krumme*

Odds are your ideas will fail. While the Lean Startup is great, it's not really a product strategy. Try, fail, pivot: might 
work for some but you'll do better with an actual strategy. Build first and ask questions later is not always the best plan.

Make something people want. This is a great goal and you'll succeed if you do this, but you need a strategy to get there and 
figure it out.

Strategy vs Tactics - a strategy is "what we are trying to do" and tactics is "how we are trying to do it"

##Step 1: Take Stock
Review what you have already, gather it together and internalize that knowledge.
- is there a business plan?
  - revenue streams
  - advantages
  - opportunities
- do you have research?
  - competitive analysis
  - ethnographies
  - market research
- anything else?
  - brand strategy
  - prototypes
  - etc
  
##Step 2: Hypotheses
Outline the belief you have about a premise and the result. State your claim and explain a little bit about why.
- test your assumptions, your hypotheses must be testable and test your riskiest assumptions first

##Step 3: Product Vision
From [Crossing the Chasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_the_Chasm):
For (target customers) who (primary opportunity), (our product name) is a (product category) that (key benefit, reason to buy).
Unlike (primary competitive alternative), our product (statement of primary definition).

##Step 4: Outcomes
What will things look like when you finish? What will your product change? What will the market look like after you've succeeded?
A feature just says what it does, while an outcome says where it's going. Outcomes can guide the features you need to get there.

##Bonus Points: Design Principles
Outline the kind of feeling your product is going to have.
