How Artificial Intelligence Can Bring Hugs, Not the Apocalypse
--------------------------------------------------
*with Tommy Lewis*

"So will AI kill us all?"

Short history in the last couple years:
- things like chatbots that were getting people out of parking tickets
- chatbots helping Kenyan farmers
- AI platforms becoming more accessible, machine learning, natural language, vision, etc
- major players are all onboard (Microsoft has 8000 employees in AI R&D), plus Amazon, Google, Apple
- while people are uninstalling apps, the messaging apps persist
- suddenly everyone is clamouring for pundits to talk about AI on the nightly news

Where are we now?
- Zuckerberg vs Musk very different views on where AI is headed
- news cycle changing, from hype to focus on the negative ie. Microsoft's Tay who learned to be incredibly racist
- refer to the hype curve, one year ago we were at the peak of inflated expectations, now we are in the trough of disillusionment
- Most technology goes through the disillusionment phase: "why would I want to touch my screen?", 
"why would I want to just use 140 characters in a message?", "why would I use emojis?", etc
