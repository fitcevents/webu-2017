From Doodles to Dashboards, Data Flows, and Docs

Using diagrams can greatly improve one's initial understanding of a concept. Take Redux. The docs are not inviting, 
state it's simple, but it's really not that clear to someone new.

Una has an Instagram account that accumulates developer doodles to explain concepts called [Dev Doodles](https://www.instagram.com/dev_doodles/).

#Sensory Memory
- spinning a rope really fast is a demonstration of how our memory has gaps, at 100ms per rotation you can see the 
spaces in the ropes path, but faster than 120ms and it starts to look continous.

#Working Memory

#Long Term Memory
- things we know how to do without having to think about them sequentially
- information encoded visually(picture), audibly(sound) and semantically(meaning)
- giving something meaning is one of the best ways to remember
- ways to learn and retain information: repeat information, make connections, being focused

A large part of our cortex is dedicated to visual association. Whereas written language is a human construct. Vision has 
been part of who we are for much longer. 

#Learning Styles
We need to diversify how we share information so we can diversify our teams. When we only share information in blocks of 
text we exclude learners who learn in different ways, such as visually.

Combining the different learning modalities is the best approach to engaging as many people as possible.

Brain has 4 different cortexs for audio, 3 for different pitches and 1 for speech. Along with visual, audio is a powerful 
way to communicate and learn.

On Una's blog she began recording audio with her posts after realizing she herself was learning better by listening to podcasts.
The feedback was super positive. Not only did this make it more accessible, it helped audio learners.

Think about page layout for learning. Using images, video, interactive code samples, typography, whitespace and callouts 
you can create a better flow and learning experience. Visual flow can hold one's attention much longer.

Emojis can actually be quite effective. The introduction of emojis to premium Twitter accounts made the tweets stand out and 
makes it easier to parse and standout.

[Atom contributing guidelines](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#git-commit-messages) uses emojis. Their style guide requires commits to start with an emoji that identifies what kind
of a contribution it is. ie. bug

Annotations and arrows with some boxes can be extremely powerful for explaining code. Flowcharts for explaining processes. 
Learn the basic [meaning of shapes in flowcharts](https://www.smartdraw.com/flowchart/flowchart-symbols.htm). 

Example: [How Slack decides to send a notification](https://twitter.com/mathowie/status/837735473745289218?lang=en)

[Draw.io](http://draw.io) - is a great, free online tool for flowcharts
[Asciiflow](asciiflow.com) - exports flowcharts in ascii, making it easy to insert into readme's, etc.
[Paper](http://fiftythree.com) for iPad has recently introduced flowcharting. 

#Diagramming for Comprehension
Using diagrams for yourself to aide in your own learning and understanding. 

"The more knowledge we've acquired about a subject, the harder it is for us to relate to learning it."

Educate & Share as a student. Contribute to open source - especially to open source documentation. 

Creating architecture diagrams for a product can help not just you, but others in your org understand processes and flows.
Creating these can even uncover bugs.

#Mnemonic Devices
1. Music (ie a jingle)
2. Name (ie. ROY G BIV)
3. Expression/Word (ie. PEMDAS)
4. Model (ie. food pyramid/plate)
5. Ode/Rhyme (In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue)
6. Note organization (ie notecards - relating info)
7. Image (image asosciations)
8. Connection (LoNgitude has an "N" so it goes north to south)
9. Spelling (Mississippi)

See [dev_doodles](https://www.instagram.com/dev_doodles/) Instagram for examples of all of these.

#Doodling
Sketchnoting is a great way to communicate large ideas and concepts. Summarize talks, meetings, books, etc.

[Bullet journalling](https://www.buzzfeed.com/rachelwmiller/how-to-start-a-bullet-journal?utm_term=.nwxOjO4G9#.tim323qEy) - for organizing yourself

When you write, you learn.
When you learn, you can teach.
When you teach, you re-enforce your knowledge.
