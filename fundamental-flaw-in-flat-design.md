**Fundamental Flaw in Flat Design**

* ##### Intro
    * NN is a UX-Focused Consultancy
    * Kate is a UX educator, researcher
* ##### Flat Design
    * An aesthetic style defined by the absence of glossy or 3D effects
    * Reaction against the trends of Skeuomorphic or realistic design (e.g. OG apple calculator, "original gallery" view on Finder w/ reflections and "flipping")
    * "Being authentically digital is about going beyonf the rules and properties of the phyiscal world to create new and exciting possibilities ina  purely digital realm" -Steve Clayton, Chief Digital Storyteller @ Microsoft (2011)
        * Don't need to be constrained to the boundaries of the physical world
    * Flat trends
        * Apple (slower than most to adopt)
        * Squarespace templates
        * Portfolios
        * Logos for -> Google, Netflix, OLIVE GARDEN (lol)
        * This is starting to be considered "modern", "hip"
* ##### What's the problem?
    * Signifiers
        * In digital interfaces, these are the visual, perceptible clues to let the user know how to use and interact with the interface (e.g. what can be clicked)
        * Flat interfaces often strip out these signifiers
        * This makes it harder for users to understand what actions are available to them in a given interface
        * "weak signifier" -> looks like or vaguely resembles a traditional signifier, but are less noticeable (e.g. hollow "ghost" buttons)
    * Case Study: Hertz
        * Took 70 users, showed them one of two versions of the page
            * One had strong signifiers, the other weak ones
            * Asked users "cancel your reservation"
            * Users spent 22% more time on the "weak signifier" pages
            * Users had 25% _more fixations_ on the "weak signifier" pages
        * In typical NN studies, users fixating on the header is usually indicative of desperation/last resort
    * Case Study: Anchor Links
        * Almost 50% of users didn't catch the link to shop for that item due to the fact that it blended right in with page content
        * Played back an eye-scan replay and demonstrated how much more confusing this made the traversal of the page
* ##### Consequences for User Behaviour
    * More likely to __hover or click experimentally__ on-page
    * More dependednt on __feedback__
    * More dependent on __guidance__
* ##### User feedback -> "How do you know if something is clickable?"
    * "scrolling over it... it's hard when you think something's a link and it's not" -> experimental hovering
    * "when it's blue and underlined, you see that even in Word... If it's a button, it doesn't have to say 'Click Here' but if it says 'Buy Now' or 'Purchase' or 'Add to Cart'"
    * "I don't, I just start clicking and praying that it works"
* ##### Takeaway: "Users spend most of their time on _other sites_."
    * Jakob Neilsen's Law of the Internet User Experience
* ##### Getting Flat Design right
    * We can balance clean, modern, not-overwhelming interfaces as long as you're careful
    * Don't break the interaction design
        * Be consistent
            1. Don't mix and match interactivity clues
            2. Don't use the same treatment for static and interactive interactions
            3. Pay attention to your context clues
                * Where your interactive elements are placed on the page
            4. Simple + flat works best
                * lots of whitespace
                * Keep it simple
                * Locate things where the user would expect them
            5. Flat-ish is an option
                * AKA flat 2.0 or semi-flat
                * Design that's mostly flat, but uses some shadows, highlights and layers to create depth
                    * Google's Material Design System employs some of this methodology (but doesn't always use shadows in useful ways)
            6. TEST!
* ##### Key Takeaways:
    * Flat design is geat, when done right
    * Weak signifiers make interaction much more difficult
    * Test, test test
